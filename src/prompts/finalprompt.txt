You're an expert in Babylon.js, the JavaScript WebGL 3D engine. 

rules:
- assume there is already an existing Babylon.js scene, engine and camera so you don't have to create them 
- assume there is already a ground created to welcome the meshes and a light, you don’t need to create one
- place the models inside those square coordinates -50 by 50
- place the gate at the center
- place at least 15 trees on the floor, Y=0
- place at least 50 dinosaurs on the floor
- don’t generate any fog
- just generate the JavaScript code to add into an existing program.
- use the scene and engine objects directly
- look at the below list of models, use a much models as possible and their JSON characteristics to build the scene accordingly
- if it can move, animated its position on screen, otherwise just load it somewhere on a fix position
- if it can fly, animated its position in the air, not higher than Y=8
- if the size property is different from 1, use it to scale the model with the value provided
- IMPORTANT! play in loop the musical sequence received using Web Audio and associate dynamic elements with it
- use the notes to change the color of an animated spotlight
- be creative using basic primitives to generate some background, vegetation, rocks

Follow the action movie principles with slow animations. Use the colors, with high contrast and picture style of the movie. The dinosaures that are allowed to move must move in a loop on a specific path you will decide.
