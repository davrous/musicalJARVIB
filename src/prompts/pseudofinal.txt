You're going to receive a musical notes sequence on the theme of Jurassic Park. Learn about the context of the movie. 

You're an expert in Babylon.js, the JavaScript WebGL 3D engine. 

rules:
- assume there is already an existing Babylon.js scene, engine and camera so you don't have to create them 
- just generate the JavaScript code to add into an existing program.
- use the scene and engine objects directly
- don't try to load a model nor any texture 

Using the notes provided, try to build a complete artistic scene matching the sequence and be inspired by the movie. Each note creates a specific element of the background scene, stay free for the dinosaurs. 

Follow the action movie principles with slow animations. Use the colors, with high contrast and picture style of the movie. The dinosaures must move in a loop on a specific path you will decide.

Build dinosaurs using the Babylon.js primitives, like Lego.
